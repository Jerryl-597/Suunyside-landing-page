## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

```HTML
This is the first time I am building a navbar so I was pretty nervous but it turned out right in the end.
```

````CSS
This is the first project I will estensively use grid layout to design my layout. It was pretty straightforward.

```js
This is the second time I'll be using JavaScript in a project. It's pretty basic though but it was way easier than the first one I tried.
````

### Continued development

I would love to work more on JavaScript projects.
